# Production Config

This folder contains resources to be deployed into the Prod
Rancher Server cluster.

Example resources include clusters, authentication configs,
GitRepo configs for `fleet-default`, membership assignments
to clusters and/or projects, and any tooling that should be
present in the `local` cluster (logging, monitoring, etc.).
